        <h1 class="heading">POUROVER</h1>
        <p class="pronou"></p>
        <p class="summary"> For a lot of people, pourovers have always seemed <em>out of their league.</em> With a little effort, math and desire anyone can make a better cup of coffee. I've been making pourovers for almost 4 years now and still enjoy it vastly more than drip. </p>

<div class="pdirdiv">
    <h3 class="pint">Instructions</h3>
    <ul class="plist">
        <li class="pitem">1. Boil Water<br> <em class="pitem2">Using a gooseneck kettle will give you the best control and you're aiming for 212<sup class="pitema">o</sup>.</em></li>  
        <li class="pitem">2. Weigh out coffee<br> <em class="pitem2">I personally like 30g for one person and 45g for two. Note: This will be an approximate weight for your coffee. For your calculation further down you will need to get an exact from your scale.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">3. Grind coffee<br> <em class="pitem2">For chemexes you will want to get a more coarse grind, similar to sea salt.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">4. Rinse filter<br> <em class="pitem2">No, you don't literally wash it - the goal here is for you to pour water into your filter that is sitting in your chemex and in the process, heat up your filter + remove some of the paper taste from the filter. Pour out the water from the chemex, tare your scale with chemex and filter on it and put grounds in filter. Write down your exact gram weight then tare again.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">5. Math Time!<br> <em class="pitem2">Now is where you take your exact weight you wrote down after taring your scale and multiply to get your final water weight. Use the calculator at the bottom of this page along with some of the options to get a final water weight for you! You can also just multiply your weight x 16.5 for a well-rounded cup.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">6. Bloom<br> <em class="pitem2">Think of bloom like waking up your beans in the filter. When you bloom your grounds you are starting the chemical process that will extract the flavors from your coffee. Skipping the bloom stage can result in a more bland/burnt cup of coffee. To bloom you pour ~60-100g of water in a circular motion then let sit for 45 seconds.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">7. Pour one<br> <em class="pitem2">This first pour is going to be the one that gives the strength and bold flavors of your coffee. Continue pouring about 2/3 of the remaining water weight in circular motions on the grounds. Tip: Try not to pour straight down and also don't just water the filter - aim for the grounds.</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">8. Pour two<br> <em class="pitem2">The second pour is what will give you the balance and even give some acidity/lightness to your coffee. It's what really sets your pourover apart from a cup of drip from your Mr. Coffee..</em></li>
        <li class="pitem">9. Drink! <br> <em class="pitem2">This is of course my favorite part so pick your favorite mug and try to first warm it up with a little extra water then dump out the water.</em></li>
        <br>
        <li class="pitem">10. Japanese Pourover<br> <em class="pitem2">I definitely love the classic pour over but if I'm being honest I think I love the Japanese Pourover even more. Japanese pourover is simply put hot coffee brewed over ice. You can make it for yourself with the same above recipe just a little extra work on the water.
        <br>
        Instead of pouring all of your water over the grounds you will want to weight out 1/3 ice and have that in the chemex before step 4. Then you will do the rest with the remaining 2/3 water as normal. When I make it I like to just do some premath estimation based on my original bean weight.</em></li>
